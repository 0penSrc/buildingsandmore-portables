<p>To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who applies for a loan or Retail Installment Contract or opens an account.
</p>
<p>
What This Means for You: When you apply for a loan or Retail Installment Contract or open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver&apos;s license or other identifying documents. In some instances, we may use outside sources to confirm the information. The information you provide is protected by our privacy policy and federal law.</p>


<h2 className="mb-2 text-4xl tracking-tight font-extrabold text-gray-900 dark:text-white text-center mt-8">Electronic Records Disclosure, Consent and Agreement to Use Electronic Signatures Agreement</h2>
<div><h4><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong></h4> <p>This Electronic Records Disclosure, Consent and Agreement to Use Electronic Signatures Agreement (“Agreement”) allows us to provide you with electronic versions of important notices and documents associated with the application, opening, and servicing of an account with  &#34; Dealer &#34; and/or RTO Finance LLC (“RTOF”). Certain laws and regulations require us to provide notices and disclosures to you in “writing” (traditionally this is defined as a paper notice). We may provide documents to you electronically and you may use an electronic signature in lieu of signing a paper document, if you consent after we have provided you with the information contained in this Agreement.</p> <br></br> <h4><strong><u>Definitions</u></strong></h4> <p>The words “we,” “our,” and “us” mean Dealer and RTOF, their affiliates, successors, and assigns. The words “you” and “your” mean each applicant, account owner and anyone else with access to the account. If there is more than one owner, then these words mean each account owner separately, and all account owners jointly. “Access Device” means any electronic device you use to access your account and view electronic documents. This includes, but is not limited to: a traditional computer such as a desktop or laptop computer; or a mobile device such as a tablet computer or a smartphone.</p> <br></br> <h4><strong><u>Your Consent to Use Electronic Signature</u></strong></h4> <p>By signing this Agreement, you consent to use your electronic signature to sign any document or communication with us.
